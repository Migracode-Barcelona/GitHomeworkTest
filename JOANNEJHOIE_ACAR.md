Hi! I’m Joanne Jhoie Acar. I love running because it clears my mind and pushes me to challenge myself. 
My favourite food is Bicol Express(A Filipino dish)I can’t get enough of its creamy coconut milk and spicy kick. 
My favourite music is [Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance](https://youtu.be/RRKJiM9Njr8?si=OAOqvSFCzHWAADjD), which always gets me fired up. 
Fun facts about me: I grew up on an island but I can’t swim, and I also keep a journal of books I’ve read, filled with my favorite quotes.
