My name is Alicia Wynona Tjahjadi.
My favorite sport is...I don't really have one, but my favorite exercise is Pilates, because I feel like it's very low intensity (I hate cardio) but it builds strength gradually.
My favorite food is noodles, especially Chinese-Indonesian style noodles, and it makes me sad that none is sold here in Barcelona and I cannot also seem to recreate them no matter how hard I try!

An interesting fact about myself: I have hypermobile joints and can dislocate multiple of them, a cool party trick :D
