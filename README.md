# Git Lesson Homework

To complete this homework you should use the Git workflow you've been learning this week.

1. Fork this repository to create a version where you are the owner
2. Clone the fork to your local machine
3. Open the local repository in VSCode
4. In VSCode, create a local branch called `bio-page`
5. Create a new file called `FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.md`
   - For example, if your name is Joe Smith then call your file `JOE_SMITH.md`
6. In this file, write an introduction yourself. You should include:
   1. Your name
   2. Your favourite sport and why you like it
   3. Your favourite food and why it's your favourite
   4. A link to a video of your favourite music
   5. An interesting fact about yourself - impress us!
7. `Commit` the file to your branch
8. `Push` the branch `bio-page` to your fork

## Creating a pull request

Finally, you'll need to get others to review your work! 
You can do this by creating a **pull request**!

To learn more about **pull requests** and how to create one, please use this guide ðŸ‘‰ https://migracode-itp.netlify.app/how-to-do-a-good-pr/

9. Open a `Pull Request` from the branch `bio-page`to your own Main repo (NOT MIGRACODE repo)

Your PR should look like this: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/GitHomeworkTest/pull/692 - Keep in mind that this example come from CYF, so the convention to name the PR is based on them, be sure to review well the PR Guide above to have the proper naming of the PR.

**Please note that your PR will not undergo an official review, as none is required, this one is just for practice** 

## Asking for Help

If you've had problems with any of the steps above, ask for help on Slack a peer or a volunteer will be able to help you!

When you ask for help you should always say what exactly isn't working

**Do not write:** "Git doesn't work. Can someone help me?"

**Do write:** "I've tried to push my file using git but it's giving me this error XYZ. I've tried to search Google for the answer but I can't find anything. Can somebody help me?"
